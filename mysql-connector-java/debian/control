Description: Java MySQL connector
 MySQL provides connectivity for client applications developed in the 
 Java programming language via a JDBC driver, which is called MySQL Connector/J.
 .
 MySQL Connector/J is a JDBC Type 4 driver. Different versions are available 
 that are compatible with the JDBC-3.0 and JDBC-4.0 specifications. 
 The Type 4 designation means that the driver is pure-Java implementation 
 of the MySQL protocol and does not rely on the MySQL client libraries.
