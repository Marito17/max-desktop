	<p><a href="http://www.max.org">Max</a> is an operating system designed with education in mind. It is based on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, a complete operating system that uses the Linux kernel and freely available to the public.</p>
  <p>The Max project is built on the ideas enshrined in the
  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/philosophy">Ubuntu philosophy</a>: that software should be available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in their local language, and that people should have the freedom to customize and alter their software in whatever way they need.</p>
