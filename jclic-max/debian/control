Description: JClic MaX modifications.
 JClic is formed by a set of computer applications that are
 used for carrying out different types of educational 
 activities: puzzles, associations, text exercises, crosswords...
 .
 The activities are not usually used alone, but packed in
 projects. A project is formed by a set of activities and one 
 or more sequences, which indicate the order in which they
 have to be shown.
 .
 The predecessor of JClic is Clic, an application that  has
 been used by educators of different countries since 1992 as 
 a tool for the creation of didactic activities for their students.
 .
 JClic is developed in the Java platform, is a free software project
 and works in different environments and operating systems.
